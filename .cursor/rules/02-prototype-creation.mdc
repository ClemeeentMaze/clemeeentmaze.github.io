# Prototype Creation Guide

**Important:** Prototypes are auto-discovered and appear in the dropdown selector automatically — but ONLY if you follow these exact conventions:

## Required Steps (all are mandatory)

1.  **Directory:** Create a folder under `src/prototypes/` using kebab-case (e.g., `src/prototypes/new-cool-feature/`)

2.  **File name must be `index.jsx`:** The main component MUST be in a file named exactly `index.jsx` — not `Index.jsx`, not `main.jsx`, not anything else.

3.  **Default export required:** The component MUST be exported as the default export.

4.  **Title property required:** Add a static `Title` property to the component. This is what displays in the dropdown selector.

5.  **Order property (recommended):** Add a static `Order` property to control the prototype's position in the list.

```javascript
function NewCoolFeature() {
  // ... component logic ...
}

NewCoolFeature.Title = "New Cool Feature";
NewCoolFeature.Description = "Optional description shown in the selector";
NewCoolFeature.Order = 30; // Controls position in prototype list
NewCoolFeature.Group = "Feature Exploration"; // Optional: groups related prototypes

export default NewCoolFeature;
```

## Prototype Groups

The `Group` property organizes related prototypes under collapsible sections in the sidebar. This is especially useful during brainstorming when exploring multiple variations of a concept.

### When to Use Groups

- **Brainstorming sessions:** Group variations like `checkout-wizard`, `checkout-single-page`, `checkout-express` under "Checkout Exploration"
- **Feature iterations:** Keep v1, v2, v3 of a feature together
- **A/B testing:** Group different approaches to compare

### Group Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names: "Checkout Exploration", "Onboarding Options", "Dashboard Layouts"
- Be consistent across related prototypes
- Groups are sorted alphabetically in the sidebar

### Example

```javascript
// Prototype 1
CheckoutWizard.Title = "Checkout - Wizard";
CheckoutWizard.Group = "Checkout Exploration";
CheckoutWizard.Order = 10;

// Prototype 2
CheckoutSinglePage.Title = "Checkout - Single Page";
CheckoutSinglePage.Group = "Checkout Exploration";
CheckoutSinglePage.Order = 20;

// Prototype 3 (ungrouped - appears at top)
Dashboard.Title = "Dashboard";
Dashboard.Order = 5;
```

**Result in sidebar:**
```
Dashboard                    ← Ungrouped (no header)
▼ Checkout Exploration (2)   ← Collapsible group
  Checkout - Wizard
  Checkout - Single Page
```

## Prototype Order Guidelines

The `Order` property determines where a prototype appears in the selector list:

- **Use increments of 10** (10, 20, 30...) to allow easy insertion of new prototypes later
- **Check existing prototypes first:** Before assigning an Order, look at the Order values in other prototypes under `src/prototypes/*/index.jsx`
- **New prototypes:** Assign the next available Order value (e.g., if highest is 20, use 30)
- **Insert between:** To add between existing prototypes, use a value in between (e.g., 15 between 10 and 20)
- **Prototypes without Order:** Appear at the end of the list

## Prototype File Structure

For more complex prototypes, organize files within the prototype directory:

```
src/prototypes/my-feature/
├── index.jsx          # Required: main component (default export)
├── annotations.json   # Optional: developer handover annotations
├── components/        # Optional: sub-components specific to this prototype
├── hooks/             # Optional: custom hooks for this prototype
├── data.js            # Optional: mock data and constants
└── styles.css         # Optional: additional styles (prefer Tailwind classes)
```

## Verification Checklist

Before considering a prototype complete, verify:
- [ ] Folder is directly under `src/prototypes/` (not nested deeper)
- [ ] Main file is named `index.jsx` (exact casing)
- [ ] Component has `export default`
- [ ] Component has a `.Title` property set
- [ ] Component has an `.Order` property set (check existing prototypes for values)
- [ ] Component has a `.Group` property if part of a brainstorming exploration
- [ ] Prototype appears in the dropdown selector

## When to Suggest Grouping

Proactively suggest adding a `Group` property when:
- Creating a new prototype that explores a variation of an existing concept
- The prototype name suggests it's part of a series (e.g., "Checkout v2", "Dashboard - Dark")
- There are 5+ prototypes in the sidebar and some appear related
- The user is brainstorming multiple approaches to the same problem

**Example suggestion:**
> "I notice you have several checkout-related prototypes. Would you like me to group them under 'Checkout Exploration' so they're easier to find?"

## Archiving Prototypes

To archive a prototype, add the `Archived` property:

```javascript
MyPrototype.Title = "Old Feature";
MyPrototype.Archived = true;  // Moves to collapsible "Archived" section
```

- The prototype moves to a collapsible "Archived" section in the sidebar
- It remains accessible via direct URL and the Archived section
- See `07-archived-prototypes.mdc` for more details
