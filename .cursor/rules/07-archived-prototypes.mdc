# Archived Prototypes

To archive a prototype (hide it from the main prototype list but keep it accessible):

## How to Archive

Add the `Archived` property to your prototype component:

```jsx
function MyPrototype() {
  return <div>...</div>;
}

MyPrototype.Title = "Old Experiment";
MyPrototype.Description = "A prototype I want to hide";
MyPrototype.Archived = true;  // This moves it to the Archived section

export default MyPrototype;
```

The prototype will move to a collapsible "Archived" section in the sidebar. It remains accessible via direct URL and can still be selected from the Archived section.

## When to Archive

- Work-in-progress prototypes not ready for review
- Completed prototypes that are no longer actively needed
- Experimental or internal-only prototypes
- Old versions kept for reference

## Archived Prototype Behavior

- Archived prototypes appear in a collapsed "Archived" section at the bottom of the prototype list
- They still support all features: Title, Description, annotations, full preview links
- The section shows a count of archived prototypes
- Click to expand/collapse the archived section

## How to Unarchive

To bring a prototype back to the main list, simply remove the `Archived` property or set it to `false`:

```jsx
// Remove this line to unarchive:
// MyPrototype.Archived = true;

// Or set it to false:
MyPrototype.Archived = false;
```

## Example

```jsx
// src/prototypes/my-experiment/index.jsx

function MyExperiment() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Experimental Feature</h1>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

MyExperiment.Title = "Feature Experiment v1";
MyExperiment.Description = "Early exploration - kept for reference";
MyExperiment.Order = 50;
MyExperiment.Archived = true;  // Hidden from main list

export default MyExperiment;
```
