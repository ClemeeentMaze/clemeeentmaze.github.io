# Prototype Isolation Rules

**CRITICAL: When working on a specific prototype, follow these rules strictly:**

## Core Isolation Principles

1. **Always confirm the active prototype**: Before making any changes, identify which prototype the user is working on. Prototypes are located in `src/prototypes/[prototype-name]/`.

2. **Never modify other prototypes**: When working on a prototype (e.g., `ariane-review`), do NOT make changes to files in other prototype directories (e.g., `ariane-showcase`, `hello-designer`).

3. **Ask for clarification if unclear**: If the user's request could apply to multiple prototypes, ask them to specify which prototype they want to modify.

4. **Verify file paths before editing**: Before making any edit, verify that the file path belongs to the correct prototype directory. The pattern should be:
   - `src/prototypes/{active-prototype-name}/**/*`

5. **When creating new files for a prototype**: Always create them within that prototype's directory unless explicitly creating a shared component.

## How to Identify the Active Prototype

- Check which files the user has open in the editor
- Look at the file paths mentioned in the conversation context
- Ask the user directly: "Which prototype are you currently working on?"
- If the user mentions a prototype by name, use that as the active context

## Shared Components Exception

The `src/_framework/components/ariane/` directory contains shared UI components that can be used by any prototype. Changes to these shared components should be made deliberately and with awareness that they affect all prototypes.

## Example Prompt for Clarification

If unsure, ask: "I see multiple prototypes in this project. Which prototype would you like me to modify? Current prototypes are: ariane-review, ariane-showcase, hello-designer"

## Pre-Edit Checklist

Before making any edit to prototype files:
- [ ] Confirmed which prototype is active
- [ ] Verified the file path matches `src/prototypes/{active-prototype}/`
- [ ] Not touching files in other prototype directories
