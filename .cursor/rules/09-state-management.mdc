# State Management

Since these are prototypes for exploration:
*   **Prefer local state** (`useState`, `useReducer`) over global state solutions
*   **Use React Context** only when multiple components need shared state within a prototype
*   **Mock data inline** or in a `data.js` file within the prototype directory
*   **Avoid external API calls** unless testing a specific integration - use mock data instead
