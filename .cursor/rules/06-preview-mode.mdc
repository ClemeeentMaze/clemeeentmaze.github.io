# Full Preview Mode

Append `?full-preview` to any prototype URL to hide the prototype selector UI. This is useful for:
*   Sharing clean prototype links with stakeholders
*   Recording demos or screenshots
*   Testing the prototype in isolation

Example: `http://localhost:5173/my-prototype?full-preview`
