# Working with Figma Designs (MCP)

When a user shares a Figma design through the Figma MCP tools, your goal is to **recreate the design as faithfully as possible using Ariane Design System components**.

---

## Core Principle

**Always use Ariane components to implement Figma designs.** The design system exists to ensure consistency between prototypes and production. Even if a Figma design uses slightly different styling, map it to the closest Ariane equivalent.

---

## Implementation Process

### 1. Analyze the Design

When receiving a Figma design via MCP:
- Identify the UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, text, layout)
- Note the visual hierarchy and spacing
- Understand the component states shown (hover, active, disabled, etc.)

### 2. Map to Ariane Components

For each element in the design, find the appropriate Ariane component:

| Figma Element | Ariane Component |
|---------------|------------------|
| Primary button | `CTAButton emphasis="primary"` |
| Secondary button | `ActionButton emphasis="secondary"` |
| Text input field | `Field` + `TextInputControl` |
| Dropdown/Select | `SimpleSelect` |
| Toggle/Switch | `Toggle` |
| Checkbox | `CheckboxField` or `CheckboxControl` |
| Card container | `Box` or `HoverCard` |
| Avatar/Profile pic | `ImageFigure` or `InitialsFigure` |
| Badge/Tag | `TextBadge` or `Tag` |
| Body text | `Text` |
| Headings | `Heading level={1-5}` |
| Layout containers | `Flex` and `Box` |

### 3. Handle Design Differences

When the Figma design doesn't exactly match Ariane:

**DO:**
- Use the closest Ariane component and extend with `className` for minor tweaks
- Match the design's spacing using Ariane tokens (XS, SM, MD, LG, XL, XXL)
- Preserve the design's visual hierarchy and intent

**DON'T:**
- Create custom styled elements when an Ariane component exists
- Ignore the design system in favor of pixel-perfect matching
- Add inline styles when Tailwind classes work

### 4. Communicate Tradeoffs

If the Figma design requires significant deviation from Ariane:
- Explain the tradeoff to the designer
- Suggest the closest Ariane alternative
- Ask if they want to proceed with a custom implementation

**Example:**
> "The Figma design shows a custom button style. I can implement this using `CTAButton` with some Tailwind overrides, which keeps it consistent with the design system. Or I can create a fully custom button if you prefer exact matching. Which approach works better for you?"

## Quick Reference

When implementing from Figma, always check:

1. **`ariane-design-system.mdc`** - Full component list and usage
2. **Ariane Components prototype** - Interactive examples of all components
3. **Spacing tokens** - XS (4px), SM (8px), MD (16px), LG (24px), XL (32px)
4. **Color tokens** - awake, dormant, critical, warning, success, featured

---

## Example Workflow

**User:** "Here's a Figma design for a settings page" (via MCP)

**AI Response:**
1. Analyze: "I see a settings page with toggles, a form section, and action buttons"
2. Map: "I'll use `Toggle` for the switches, `Field` + `TextInputControl` for inputs, and `CTAButton` for the save action"
3. Implement: Build using Ariane components with appropriate spacing
4. Note differences: "The Figma shows 20px spacing between sections - I'm using `LG` (24px) which is the closest Ariane token"

---

## Remember

- **Design system first** - Ariane components ensure prototypes match production
- **Extend, don't replace** - Use `className` for minor styling adjustments
- **Communicate** - Let designers know when you're adapting the design to fit the system
- **Check the showcase** - The Ariane Components prototype has examples of everything available
