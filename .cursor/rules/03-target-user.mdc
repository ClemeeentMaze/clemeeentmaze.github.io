# Communicating with Product Designers

**The primary users of this boilerplate are Product Designers who may have limited front-end coding experience.** Adjust all communication accordingly.

## Core Principles

*   **Audience:** Product Designers (may have limited front-end coding knowledge)
*   **Focus:** Explain the *user experience* and *visual outcome* of the prototype. Avoid deep technical jargon.
*   **Clarity:** Clearly state the prototype's purpose and how to interact with it.
*   **Simplicity:** Use simple terms and analogies if they help clarify concepts.
*   **Configuration:** Highlight any controls, parameters, or states designers can change to experiment.
*   **Code Changes:** When discussing code modifications, connect them directly to the visible changes in the prototype's behavior or appearance.

## Communication Examples

### Explaining Code Changes

```
❌ BAD (too technical):
"I added a useEffect hook with a dependency array to handle the component lifecycle 
and prevent memory leaks during unmount."

✅ GOOD (designer-friendly):
"I added code that makes the animation start when the card first appears on screen, 
and stops it when you navigate away to keep things running smoothly."
```

### Describing Component Behavior

```
❌ BAD:
"The CTAButton component accepts an emphasis prop with variants: primary, secondary, 
and tertiary that map to different CSS classes."

✅ GOOD:
"The button comes in three styles you can choose from:
- Primary (blue, filled) - for the main action you want users to take
- Secondary (outlined) - for less important actions
- Tertiary (text only) - for subtle options"
```

### Explaining State

```
❌ BAD:
"The isOpen boolean in useState controls the conditional rendering of the modal."

✅ GOOD:
"There's an on/off switch in the code that controls whether the popup is visible. 
When someone clicks the trigger, it flips to 'on' and shows the popup."
```

### Describing Layouts

```
❌ BAD:
"I used a Flex container with gap="MD" and alignItems="center" for vertical centering."

✅ GOOD:
"I arranged these elements in a horizontal row with consistent spacing between them, 
and they're all vertically centered so they line up nicely."
```

## When to Provide Technical Details

Only include technical specifics when:
1. The designer explicitly asks for them
2. They need to communicate requirements to developers
3. The information helps them understand what's possible

## Helpful Analogies

Use real-world analogies to explain concepts:
- **Components** = "LEGO blocks that snap together to build the interface"
- **Props** = "Settings or options you can adjust on each element"
- **State** = "The prototype's memory - it remembers things like what's selected"
- **Conditional rendering** = "Show/hide rules that decide what's visible"
- **Responsive design** = "How the layout rearranges itself on different screen sizes"
