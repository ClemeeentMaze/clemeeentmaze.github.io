# Shared vs Prototype-Specific Components

When creating new components, follow this decision tree:

## 1. First: Check Ariane Design System

**Before creating ANY component**, check if it exists in Ariane (`src/components/ariane/`):

```jsx
import { CTAButton, TextInputControl, Avatar, Flex } from '@/components/ariane';
```

See `ariane-design-system.mdc` for the complete component catalog.

## 2. If Not in Ariane: Decide Placement

### Shared Components (`src/components/shared/`)

Place components here **only** if they are:
*   **Truly generic** - Not bound to change meaningfully across prototypes
*   **Reusable across multiple prototypes** - Useful in 2+ prototypes without modification
*   **Stable in design** - Unlikely to need prototype-specific variations
*   **Not suitable for Ariane** - Too specific to this repo's needs

Examples: Prototype-specific layout wrappers, specialized data visualizations

Create the `src/components/shared/` folder if it doesn't exist.

### Prototype-Specific Components (`src/prototypes/<name>/components/`)

Keep components here if they are:
*   **Specific to one prototype's needs**
*   **Likely to evolve differently** per prototype
*   **Tied to prototype-specific logic or design**

Examples: Custom cards, prototype-specific modals, specialized input forms

## Decision Flowchart

```
Need a UI component?
    │
    ├─→ Does Ariane have it? ──→ YES ──→ Use Ariane component
    │                                     (extend with className if needed)
    │
    └─→ NO
         │
         ├─→ Reusable across prototypes? ──→ YES ──→ src/components/shared/
         │
         └─→ NO ──→ src/prototypes/<name>/components/
```

## Rule of Thumb

1. **Ariane first** - Always check the design system
2. **Tailwind extend** - Use className for minor adjustments
3. **When in doubt, keep it at the prototype level** - Easier to promote later
