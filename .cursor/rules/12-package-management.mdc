# Package Management

**Use Yarn as the package manager** for this project.

## Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install dependencies | `yarn install` or `yarn` |
| Add a package | `yarn add <package-name>` |
| Add a dev dependency | `yarn add -D <package-name>` |
| Remove a package | `yarn remove <package-name>` |
| Run dev server | `yarn dev` |
| Build for production | `yarn build` |
| Run linter | `yarn lint` |

## Why Yarn over npm

*   **Consistent lockfile:** `yarn.lock` ensures deterministic installs across environments
*   **Faster installs:** Parallel downloads and efficient caching
*   **Better workspace support:** Useful if project grows to monorepo structure

## Important

*   **Do NOT use `npm install`** — this creates `package-lock.json` which conflicts with `yarn.lock`
*   If you see a `package-lock.json` file, delete it and use `yarn.lock` instead
*   Always commit `yarn.lock` to version control
