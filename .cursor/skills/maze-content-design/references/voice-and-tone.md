# Voice and Tone

## Voice: Who Maze is

Maze's voice reflects three qualities across all surfaces:

### 1. Connectors
Make complex ideas simple. Explain things clearly, logically, and in a way that helps users understand what to do next.

### 2. Empathetic
Consider the user's context and emotional state. Guide without pressure and remove obstacles where possible.

### 3. Human
Sound like people: warm, informal, and transparent. Light, natural playfulness is allowed — never goofy or at the cost of clarity.

## Tone: How to adapt

Tone changes based on two dimensions:
- **Impact:** How much the moment affects the user
- **Involvement:** What the user needs — awareness or action
